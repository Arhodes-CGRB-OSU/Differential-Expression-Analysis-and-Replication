Easy, right? Not, exactly.\r\n\r\n* We have integer counts and not continous measurements. Data is not normally distributed, so statistical methods we applied to microarray data don't work here.\r\n\r\n* Replication levels in designed RNA-Seq experiments tend to be modest, often not much more than two or three. As a result, there is a need for statistical methods that perform well in small-sample situations.\r\n\r\n* There is a dependence of variance on the mean (which changes with increasing number of replicates)\r\n\r\n`Solution`: Appropriate modelling of the mean-variance relationship in DGE data is important for making inferences about differential expression. Employing methods which assess the mean-variance relationship to help with the problem of estimating biological variability for experiments with small number of replicates.\r\n\r\nIn this module, learners will use R Statistical Software to walk-through activities designed to compare the performance of different tools (edgeR, DESeq2, limma-voom) for differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq data, and how the mean-variance relationship is addressed in datasets with increasing number of replicates.\r\n\r\n### Learning Objectives\r\n\r\n* understanding the relationship between mean and variance and how that changes with the number of replicates\r\n* familariizing with tools for DE analysis in R\r\n* understanding the importance of having replicates in a RNA-Seq study\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis tutorial is based on a presentation by Meeta Mistry from the Harvard School of Public Health (@mistrm82), adapted for use in the Winter 2016 RNA-Seq Analysis Module II Workshop on Differential Expression presented by Adelaide Rhodes (@Arhodes-CGRB-OSU), Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing at Oregon State University.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
